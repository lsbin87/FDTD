Topic: 	Finite Difference in Time Domain (FDTD) Calculation Machine
Abstract:
		FDTD is one of methods to simulate EM waves, which is often used in
	simulating nano or micro structure such as nanoantennas.
		This script provides the mutual simulator of FDTD method in 3-D with
	CPML, TFSF structures. This's a fundamental tool for Master students. You 
	can	add any structure, source, or PML you want. It's very easy to understand
	by reading the structure of program below at first. Hope this tool would
	help you do some simulation research.
